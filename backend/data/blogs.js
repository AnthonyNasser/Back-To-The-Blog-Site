			Ahh. Huh? Now Biff, don't con me. Now that's a risk you'll have to take you're life depends on it. It's my dad. \
			It's about the future, isn't it? This sounds pretty heavy. But I can't go to the dance, I'll miss my favorite television program, Science Fiction Theater. Ah, where're my pants? Go \
			Well gee, I don't know. Hey c'mon, I had to change, you think I'm going back in that zoot suit? The old man really came through it worked. Okay, real mature guys. Okay, Biff, will you pick up my books? Because, you might regret it later in life. What\'s going on? Where have you been all week? \
			Scram, McFly. Don't pay any attention to him, he's in one of his moods. Sam, quit fiddling with that thing, come in here to dinner. Now let's see, you already know Lorraine, this is Milton, this is Sally, that's Toby, and over there in the playpen is little baby Joey. Doc, you don't just walk into a store and ask for plutonium. Did you rip this off? But, what are you blind McFly, it's there. How else do you explain that wreck out there? Because, you might regret it later in life. \
			Are those my clocks I hear? Tab? I can't give you a tab unless you order something. The future, it's where you're going? George, buddy. remember that girl I introduced you to, Lorraine. What are you writing? Oh.",

			"Ahh. Alright, good-bye Einy. Oh, watch that re-entry, it's a little bumpy. We never would have fallen in love. C'mon, c'mon let's go. Yeah. \
			On the night I go back in time, you get- Doc. My god, it's my mother. Put your pants back on. I'm gonna ram him. Just turn around, McFly, and walk away. Are you deaf, McFly? Close the door and beat it. Now, now, Biff, now, I never noticed any blindspot before when I would drive it. Hi, son. \
			Looks like a airplane, without wings. Doc, you gotta help- What? I\'m telling the truth, Doc, you gotta believe me. Oh, thank you, thank you. Okay now, we run some industrial strength electrical cable from the top of the clocktower down to spreading it over the street between two lamp posts. Meanwhile, we out-fitted the vehicle with this big pole and hook which runs directly into the flux-capacitor. At the calculated moment, you start off from down the street driving toward the cable execrating to eighty-eight miles per hour. According to the flyer, at !0:04 pm lightning will strike the clocktower sending one point twenty-one gigawatts into the flux-capacitor, sending you back to 1985. Alright now, watch this. You wind up the car and release it, I\'ll simulate the lightening. Ready, set, release. Huhh.\
			I think you got the wrong car, McFly. I know, and all I could say is I'm sorry. Here you go, lady. There's a quarter. Not a word, not a word, not a word now. Quiet, uh, donations, you want me to make a donation to the coast guard youth auxiliary? Hot, Jesus Christ, Doc. Jesus Christ, Doc, you disintegrated Einstein. \
			Yeah, well, I still don\'t understand what Dad was doing in the middle of the street. Save the clock tower. Biff, stop it. Biff, you're breaking his arm. Biff, stop. Who is that guy. Well, they're bigger than me.\
			How could I have been so careless. One point twenty-one gigawatts. Tom, how am I gonna generate that kind of power, it can't be done, it can't. Great Scott. Let me see that photograph again of your brother. Just as I thought, this proves my theory, look at your brother. What? Why do you keep following me around? Now, Biff, um, can I assume that your insurance is gonna pay for the damage?",

		Hey, not too early I sleep in on Saturday. Oh, McFly, your shoe's untied. Don't be so gullible, McFly. You got the place fixed up nice, McFly. I have you're car towed all the way to your house and all you've got for me is light beer. What are you looking at, butthead. Say hi to your mom for me. Doc, you don't just walk into a store and ask for plutonium. Did you rip this off? Yeah, it's 8:00. you guys look great. Mom, you look so thin. Uh, yeah.\
		Children. Your not gonna be picking a fight, Dad, dad dad daddy-o. You're coming to a rescue, right? Okay, let's go over the plan again. 8:55, where are you gonna be. Take care. Where? The flux capacitor.\
		Let's put him in there. C'mon, open up, let me out of here, Yo. Marty, that's completely out of the question, you must not leave this house. you must not see anybody or talk to anybody. Anything you do could have serious repercussions on future events. Do you understand? Never mind that now, never mind that now. You wait and see, Mr. Caruthers, I will be mayor and I'll be the most powerful mayor in the history of Hill Valley, and I'm gonna clean up this town.\
		He's fine, and he's completely unaware that anything happened. As far as he's concerned the trip was instantaneous. That's why Einstein's watch is exactly one minute behind mine. He skipped over that minute to instantly arrive at this moment in time. Come here, I'll show you how it works. First, you turn the time circuits on. This readout tell you where you're going, this one tells you where you are, this one tells you where you were. You imput the destination time on this keypad. Say, you wanna see the signing of the declaration of independence, or witness the birth or Christ. Here's a red-letter date in the history of science, November 5, 1955. Yes, of course, November 5, 1955. C'mon, c'mon. George, buddy. remember that girl I introduced you to, Lorraine. What are you writing? I don't wanna know your name. I don't wanna know anything anything about you. No no no, Doc, I just got here, okay, Jennifer's here, we're gonna take the new truck for a spin.\
		Take care. C'mon, c'mon. Yeah, well, how about my homework, McFly? C'mon, Mom, make it fast, I'll miss my bus. Hey see you tonight, Pop. Woo, time to change that oil. Mayor Goldie Wilson, I like the sound of that.",
